------------Introduction----------------
the goal of this set of files is to get a basic intro to making a simple fastapi backend, and then getting it to integrate with the existing python UI made in the "pyqt-tutorials" directory

If you are wondering the lineage of this is in my development history, refer to my commits on github, but, this is a direct sequel to the "pyqt-tutorials" directory 
------------Goals-----------------------

Assuming I get a script here to send something to that tdc001-ui.py file, it will be a walk in the park for the rest. 

For this basic one, I just want it to send 2 drop down list items to the UI for "ports" since that's the first thing the user must do to actually use the interface (give usb port)
